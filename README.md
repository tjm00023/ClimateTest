Project Overview
This repository contains the foundation of a website with multiple pages, primarily focusing on the home page. While the foundational work is in place, the website still requires significant development and enhancement.

Page Description
The website currently consists of three main pages: Home, Train, and Airplane.

Home Page: Features a table with two pressable buttons, leading to corresponding pages. Beneath the table, there are sections highlighting the benefits of traveling via skylines and trains. Bootstrap is utilized to dynamically change the theme of the pages.

Train Page: Description here.

Airplane Page: Description here.

Research Summary
During the development process, I conducted research on various websites to gather inspiration and insights for design and functionality.

Weather.com: Admired the use of different bubbles for news/topics, creating a clean and organized layout. Particularly liked the emphasis on the top story and the intuitive navigation.

Southwest.com: Analyzed the website's structure and user interface, noting the clarity and prominence of navigation elements. Inspired by the prominent navigation bar and the straightforward user experience.

TheTrainLine.com: Appreciated the simplicity and usability of the home page, with a focus on keeping the user interface clear and easily accessible. Noted the use of separate divs for sections instead of traditional table elements.

Repositories
During the research phase, I explored repositories related to weather tracking and visualization, as well as weather apps developed using Flutter.

Enhance cleanliness and organization of pages.
Improve coding practices.
Implement more creative elements and features.
